/*The calculator is the variable because it does not change but the keys: add;
subtract; multiply; divide do because we want them to do something*/

Worked on another method with Ara and Anu earlier in class, but I am implementing
my thinking and what we applied in class by myself. Within the last hour
I have been testing my .js in the console with no avail to getting what I want.
I will continue in the morning and ask questions, collaborate and use additional
resources (Google, notes, etc..). Before leaving I looked at it again and
Googled 'write a function to add two numbers javascript' which brought me closer
and I feel confident in the change that I made, but unsure of what to input
in the console.*/




let calculator = {
  a = 0;
  b = 1;
  add: evaluate = number(a) + number(b);

    }

  },

  subtract: function () {

  },

  multiply: function (){

  },

  divide: function (){

  },


},










/*let car = {
  make: "honda",
  model: "civic",
  year: "1997",
} */



/*let result = 0;

    add: function (a, b = 0) {
    result = a + b;
    }

    multiply:
    subtract:
    divide:

}*/
